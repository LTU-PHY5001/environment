# Pinned core tooling for MQIT portable environment (Windows 11-safe)
# Notes:
# - We prefer manylinux/Windows wheels only (installer enforces --only-binary)
# - Numpy pin avoids accidental major jumps while allowing security/bugfixes
# - notebook/ipykernel are pinned to the 7.x / 6.x tracks for stability on Win
numpy>=2.0,<2.3
jupyter>=1.0,<2.0
notebook>=7.2,<8.0
ipykernel>=6.29,<7.0
# QDK (Python) for Q#/IQ# interop; keep within minor while allowing patches
